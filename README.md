This repository contains FLOSS code that is not maintained and/or
actively developed anymore by the LibreOffice project.

The code provided here is *NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION*, as it lacks
updated security auditing (and probably contains insecure code) and
Quality Assurance. Releases are *NOT* provided for this code any more.

Please use the active upstream repo instead:
 https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=make

On the off-chance that LibreOffice ever needs to return maintaining
its own fork of GNU make for building the office suite, see here for
how to get this back from read-only mode:
